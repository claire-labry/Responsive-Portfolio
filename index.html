                <p>Hi there, World! My name is Claire Labry and I'm an aspiring coder. I love to debug codes, put puzzles together, and figure out solutions to problems!</p>
                
                <p>A few of my favorite things to do are to read books in the nook of my couch in my living room, discover + collect new plants, gardening, spending time outside, and learning new skills, such as knitting. You can bascially say that I'm a Grandma at heart. :P</pclass="blocktext">
               
                <p >One of the things I'm grateful most of is that I'm deaf. It gives me an unique perspective of the world, it can be challenging at times but I wouldn't have it one way or another. </p>
               
                <p>It's a pleasure to meet you!</p>
